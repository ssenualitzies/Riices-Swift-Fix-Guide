### 1. Verify Swift Status
Before attempting any fixes, check the status badge at the top of this guide and join the official [Swift Discord](https://discord.gg/getswiftgg) to check the **Status Channel**.

### 2. Dependencies Installation
Missing runtimes cause errors. Install everything from the [Dependencies](#dependencies) section below. After installation, **restart your PC**.

### 3. Windows Security Guide
> [!TIP]
> Antivirus software often flags Swift by mistake. You must add an exception for Swift.

#### Add Exceptions (Recommended)
- [Windows 10 Exceptions Guide (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BonLkFNnO9w)
- [Windows 11 Exceptions Guide (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGiNGnX5dYg)

Add this folder path to your exceptions:
- Your Swift installation folder (e.g., `C:\Users\YourName\Swift`)

If you use another antivirus (like McAfee, Norton, etc.), search YouTube for "how to disable [Your Antivirus Name]".

### 4. Workspace / Scripts / Auto-Execute Access Guide
To find your script folders, open the Run dialog (`Win + R`), type **`%appdata%\swift`**, and press Enter.

Inside, you will find these folders:
- `workspace` - Contains internal Swift files. Usually, you don't need to touch this.
- `scripts` - Place your personal `.lua` script files here.
- `autoexecute` - Any scripts placed here will run automatically when you inject. For specific setup steps, see the guides below.

### 5. Auto-Execute Setup Guide (First Method)
1. Go to the `%appdata%\swift\autoexecute` folder as described in the [guide above](#4-workspace--scripts--auto-execute-access-guide).
2. Create a text file with your script, then rename it from `.txt` to `.lua`.
3. Restart Swift.

### 6. Alternate Auto-Execute Fix (If First Method Fails)
Use the `autoexec` shortcut inside your main Swift installation folder and place your `.lua` file there.

### 7. Time Sync Fix
If you get a "System clock incorrect" error:
1. Open **Settings ‚Üí Time & Language ‚Üí Date & Time**.
2. Turn on **Set Time Automatically** and click **Sync Now**.
3. If it fails, run [this `timesync.bat` file](https://github.com/riicess/Swift-TroubleShooting-Guide/blob/main/timesync.bat) as an administrator.

### 8. Notepad / Crash Fix Guide
A crash on injection is typically a version mismatch or file corruption issue. The best solution is to follow the [Full Uninstall and Reinstall](#full-uninstall-and-reinstall) guide below.

### 9. Advanced Notepad Crash / Injection Fix
Using a managed launcher can solve persistent crash issues. See the [Bloxstrap Setup](#-bloxstrap-setup) and [Fishstrap Setup](#-fishstrap-setup) guides for detailed instructions.

### 10. Injection Timeout Error Fix
This critical error usually relates to timing, permissions, or missing files.

**Timing is Key:**
 - **Standard Roblox Launcher:** Inject Swift **immediately** after clicking the launch button. Try to attach once or twice during this early startup phase. Do **NOT** wait for the Roblox homepage to load.
 - **Bloxstrap/Fishstrap Users:** Wait for the "Starting Roblox..." popup, then try to attach once or twice. Do **NOT** spam the attach button.

**Permissions & Processes:**
- **Run as Administrator:** Ensure you are running both Swift and Roblox as an administrator.
- **Check Task Manager:** If Swift says 'no Roblox process found', open Task Manager (`Ctrl+Shift+Esc`), look for any `RobloxPlayerBeta.exe` processes and end them. Relaunch Roblox and immediately try attaching again.

**Corrupted or Missing Files:**
- **Check for `luau-lsp.exe`:** If this file is missing from your Swift folder (often due to antivirus), you will likely get a timeout error every time. Restore it from your antivirus quarantine.
- **Restore Permissions:** If you think a file's permissions are broken, you can try to [restore the EXE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWaw1XZJj58).
- **Perform a Full Reinstall:** If nothing else works, a complete reinstallation often fixes hidden problems. Follow the [Full Uninstall and Reinstall](#full-uninstall-and-reinstall) guide.

### 11. Black Screen on Injection Fix
This is rare. You can try disabling fullscreen optimizations for your launcher or use the fix files from [this MediaFire folder](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/g3a3uxxg14qlg/Black_Screen_Fix).

### 12. Swift Module Not Update / VPN Error / Website Not Loading Fix
These are connection issues. The solution is almost always a [VPN](#what-vpn-to-use). See the linked guide for a recommended VPN and setup instructions.

### 13. Roblox Downgrade Guide
> [!CAUTION]
> **Downgrading is NOT recommended. It carries a high risk of being detected.**
> If you still proceed, do so at your own risk. We highly recommend using an alternate account.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> An older Roblox version will often cause Swift to fail. It's best to wait for Swift to be updated for the latest Roblox version.

If you ignore these warnings and must downgrade, you can find the older client files yourself using the [Roblox Version Help](#roblox-version-help) guide.

### 14. Early Key Expire Fix
See the [Key System Problems](#key-system-problems) section below for this fix.

### 15. üîë WorkLink Easy Key Method ‚Äì Full Guide
To ensure a smooth key generation process, please follow the steps below carefully. 
>[!NOTE]
>For a quick visual guide, here is a video tutorial: **[Key System Tutorial](https://media.catgirl.dpdns.org/ea1f547/)**\
> For other common issues, see the [Key System Problems](#key-system-problems) section.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Before You Begin:

1. **Disable Real-Time Protection**
   Open your antivirus settings and make sure **Real-Time Protection** is turned **off**, as well as **Dev Drive Protection**. Refer to the [Windows Security Guide](#3-windows-security-guide-for-injection-issues) for help. For a visual guide, see this image:
   ![Antivirus Real-Time Protection Off](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1209716503214293082/1380551174092230839/RLROR5G.png?ex=684449f9&is=6842f879&hm=70d71fc3686ea3fa39606da5ffc0acb62880c000d4755c5f5bd02dc297a3de99&=&width=676&height=423)

2. **Disable VPNs**
   Ensure any [VPN](#what-vpn-to-use) is turned **off** before proceeding.

3. **Use a Private Browser Window**
   Open the browser in **Incognito/Private Mode** (works with Chrome, Edge, Opera, Brave, Firefox).

---

#### üß© Key Generation Steps:

1. **Launch Swift as Administrator**
   Right-click `Swift.exe` and select **‚ÄúRun as administrator‚Äù**, then click the **‚ÄúGet Key‚Äù** button.

2. **Go to Destination**
   Wait for the **"Go to Destination"** button to appear, then click it.

3. **Handle Instant Access Prompt**
   On the new page, click **"Instant Access"**, press the x, and return to the **"Go to Destination"** button again.

4. **Stay on Page**
   Remain on the new page for **15 seconds**, then click **"Access Link"**.

5. **Access Locked Page**
   When you reach the **"Access Locked"** page, you‚Äôll be prompted to complete 2+ actions. Rapidly click the **‚ÄúSkip‚Äù** button until **"Go to Destination"** becomes clickable again.

6. **Repeat**
   Repeat steps **2 to 5** **three more times**. After that, your key should be successfully retrieved.

‚úÖ If done correctly, you‚Äôll now have your key ready.
If it doesn‚Äôt work, double-check that antivirus protection and [VPNs](#what-vpn-to-use) are fully disabled, and that you‚Äôre using a private browsing window.

### 16. Lifetime Access Status
Lifetime access is currently unavailable.

### 17. How to Check Roblox Version & Confirm Update
For a complete guide on how to check, manage, and download specific Roblox versions, please refer to the detailed [Roblox Version Help](#roblox-version-help) section below.

### 18. Verify Swift Attachment via Developer Console
In Roblox, press `F9`. In Swift's console, type `print("hello")` and check if "hello" appears in the F9 console.

### 19. GPU Error Fix Notice
This error means there is an incompatibility with your **Roblox version/Windows version/GPU**. Swift may not support the current Roblox update. Check the Discord for announcements and see the [Roblox Version Help](#roblox-version-help) guide.

### 20. FAQ: Is Swift a Virus? Is It Safe?
No. Antivirus flags it for its injection behavior. Always download from the official site.

### 21. Swift is NOT a RAT ‚Äì False Positive Explanation
Scans show false positives due to security measures. See reports at [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/3b19486b4e14b206ec8ab2602ec6a430f9fce7ef40247b1e1f4c6f004ee468b4/community) and [Triage](https://tria.ge/250331-xzst9ayrt2).

## Key System Problems

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You may have key system issues on some browsers. Using Microsoft Edge in an Incognito window usually solves these problems.\
> Here is a quick [tutorial](https://media.catgirl.dpdns.org/ea1f547/) for the key system. **Note:** The tutorial does not show incognito mode, but we strongly recommend you use it.

>[!NOTE]
>Remember, you can skip the **tasks**. DO NOT download anything from the key system site.
> - Press "Choose another offer".
> - Then press "Skip" till "Go to destination" button turns green then Click the button.
> - If it doesn't, try refreshing the page.

### Swift website won‚Äôt load?
- Try using the [Warp VPN](#what-vpn-to-use).

> [!NOTE]
> If you get a key while using a VPN, you **MUST** redeem it with the same VPN. After that, you can usually turn the VPN off.

### Workink issues?
- Try disabling your [VPN](#what-vpn-to-use).
- Consider using [Quad9 DNS](https://youtube.com/watch?v=aujUl3yt6nM).
- Refresh any stuck tasks on the key system page.
- If you get an article task, click and interact with the article in **the same browser tab** that opens.

### Early Expire?
- Check your clipboard history (**Windows key + V**) for the old key.
- Paste the old key into Swift and click **Submit**. You may need to try this multiple times.
- If you don't have the old key, you must get a new one.
