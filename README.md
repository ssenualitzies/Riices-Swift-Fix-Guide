# Ssenualitzies Swift Fixes Guide #

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING:**  
> Swift is a third-party Roblox script executor that modifies Roblox process memory to inject scripts. This behavior can trigger detections by Roblox‚Äôs anti-cheat systems, antivirus software, and Windows Defender. Use at your own risk.  
> Always use alternative accounts, avoid risky behavior, and back up your data.

## 1. Verify Swift Status

Before attempting any fixes or troubleshooting, always **check Swift‚Äôs current operational status** to avoid wasting time on local troubleshooting when the problem is global.

- Visit the official Swift Discord server:  
  üîó [discord.gg/getswiftgg](https://discord.gg/getswiftgg)  
- Check the pinned **Status Channel** for updates on server outages, patch deployments, or known issues:  
  üì¢ [Status Channel](https://discord.com/channels/1311387776893321337/1364742225942286409)

If Swift is down or undergoing maintenance, wait for official announcements before continuing.



## 2. Dependencies Installation

Swift depends on several runtime libraries and frameworks to function correctly. Missing or outdated dependencies can cause errors like **Authentication Failed** or **InjectTimeout**.

Please ensure you have the following installed on your Windows system:

- [.NET SDK 8.0.411 (Windows x64)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/sdk-8.0.411-windows-x64-installer) ‚Äî Make sure to install the **SDK** and **not just the runtime**.
- [Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2022 (x64)](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)
- [Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2022 (x86)](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x86.exe)
- [Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=2124703)
- [DirectX Runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109)
- [Direct3D Runtime (d3d)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35)

**After installing these, restart your PC** to ensure all changes are applied correctly.



## 3. Windows Security Guide for Injection Issues

Windows Defender or third-party antivirus software may block Swift‚Äôs injection process, causing errors like inject timeout or failed launches.

Follow these steps:

1. Press `Win + I` and go to **Update & Security > Windows Security**.
2. Click **Virus & Threat Protection**.
3. Disable **Real-time protection** and **Tamper protection** temporarily.
4. Scroll down to **Exclusions** and add your entire **Swift installation folder**.
5. Review your antivirus quarantine or protection history and **restore/allow** any Swift-related files (`*.exe`, `*.dll`).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Remember to re-enable your antivirus after using Swift to keep your PC protected.



## 4. Workspace / Scripts / Auto-Execute Access Guide

If you are unsure where to find your Swift scripts or how to add scripts for auto-execution, follow this:

- Press `Win + R`, enter `%appdata%\Swift` and hit Enter.
- Inside, you will find folders:  
  - `workspace` (for internal Swift files, rarely edited)  
  - `scripts` (where you can store your `.lua` script files)  
  - `autoexecute` (folder for scripts that auto-run on injection)
- To add an auto-execute script:  
  - Open the `autoexecute` folder  
  - Create a `.txt` file or paste your script inside an existing file  
  - Save and restart Swift to apply



## 5. Auto-Execute Setup Guide (First Method)

To enable auto-execute correctly:

1. Open `Win + R` and navigate to:  
   `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Roaming\Swift\autoexecute`
2. Create a new `.txt` file using Notepad.
3. Paste your script code inside this `.txt` file.
4. Save and close the file.
5. Relaunch Swift and inject as usual ‚Äî the script will auto-execute upon injection.



## 6. Alternate Auto-Execute Fix (If First Method Fails)

If the above method doesn‚Äôt trigger auto-execute:

1. Close Swift completely.
2. Open the Swift installation folder.
3. Navigate to the **autoexec** folder (which is a shortcut to `%appdata%\Swift\autoexecute`).
4. Place your script as a `.lua` file inside this folder.
5. Launch Roblox manually.
6. Attach Swift injector to Roblox.
7. The script should auto-execute on injection.



## 7. Time Sync Fix

Incorrect system time can cause authentication errors or key verification failures.

To fix:

1. Search for **"Date & Time"** in Windows Start menu.
2. Open **Date & Time Settings**.
3. Click **Sync Now** under **Synchronize your clock**.
4. Wait for confirmation and try again.



## 8. Notepad / Crash Fix Guide

If Roblox crashes or Swift does not attach correctly:

- Press `Win + R`, enter `%localappdata%`, and delete these folders if they exist:  
  `Roblox`, `Bloxstrap`, `Fishstrap`
- Reinstall Roblox from [RDD by Weao](https://rdd.weao.xyz/) (use the second highlighted download link).
- Run both Roblox and Swift as Administrator.
- Attach Swift after launching Roblox.



## 9. Advanced Notepad Crash / Injection Fix

If crashes persist:

- Use **Fishstrap** launcher with these settings:  
  - Deployment: `Production`  
  - Auto Channel Change: `Always Prompt`
- Launch Roblox via Fishstrap or RDD.
- Attach Swift immediately after Roblox loading message.
- Use screenshots (if needed) to verify Fishstrap configuration.



## 10. Injection Timeout Error Fix

If you get inject timeout errors:

- Use an Administrator Windows account.
- Completely uninstall Roblox and Swift.
- Reinstall Swift (https://getswift.gg).
- Download Roblox using RDD or Fishstrap.
- Run Swift and Roblox as admin.
- Attach Swift at the correct time.



## 11. Black Screen on Injection Fix

Rare black screen issues can be fixed by:

- Downloading batch files from [this MediaFire folder](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/g3a3uxxg14qlg/Black_Screen_Fix) that match your Roblox client.
- Run the batch file as Administrator.
- Alternatively, disable fullscreen optimizations in Bloxstrap properties.



## 12. Swift Not Updating / VPN Error / Website Not Loading Fix

If Swift won‚Äôt update or the key system website errors:

- Download and enable **Cloudflare WARP** from https://1.1.1.1/  
- Enable WARP from system tray icon.
- Relaunch Swift and try again.
- Use Edge or Chrome incognito/private browsing mode for key system access.


## 13. Roblox Downgrade Guide (If Swift is Down)

To exploit when Swift is broken on the latest Roblox version:

- Visit [RDD Weao](https://rdd.weao.xyz/).
- Download an older Roblox version by using the Version Hash.
- Extract and run RobloxPlayerBeta.exe from the older version folder.
- Beware of ban risks; use alternative accounts and VPNs.



## 14. Ad Blocker Pop-up Fix for Key System

If the key system shows ad-block detection:

- Use **Microsoft Edge**.
- Open Developer Tools (`Ctrl + Shift + I`).
- Find and remove the HTML elements triggering the ad-block popup.
- Repeat until the page proceeds and key is accessible.



## 15. CAPTCHA Bug Troubleshooting

If CAPTCHA won‚Äôt load:

- Click **Continue** multiple times.
- Refresh the page.
- Try a different browser or open the page in private/incognito mode (`Ctrl + Shift + N`).
- Microsoft Edge in incognito often works best.



## 16. No License Found ‚Äì Suggested Solutions

When seeing "No License Found":

- Use a VPN and refresh.
- Retry the key system multiple times.
- Use Microsoft Edge incognito mode for best results.



## 17. Lifetime Access Status

Lifetime access is currently not available.

Watch for official announcements in the Swift Discord channel:  
https://discord.com/channels/1311387776893321337/1364332154439471284



## 18. How to Check Roblox Version & Confirm Update

To check your Roblox client version:

1. Locate your Roblox executable (RobloxPlayerBeta.exe, Bloxstrap.exe, or Fishstrap.exe).
2. Right-click > Properties > Details tab.
3. The version hash should match: `version-82f8ee8d17124507`
4. If not matching, reinstall Roblox using the official links.



## 19. Verify Swift Attachment via Developer Console

To confirm Swift attached correctly:

- Open Roblox.
- Press `F9` to open the Developer Console.
- In the Swift console, type: `print("hello")`
- Check if "hello" appears in the developer console output.
- Provide a screenshot if support is needed.



## 20. GPU Error Fix Notice

If you receive an "Incompatible GPU Driver" error:

- This is due to using a Roblox version Swift doesn‚Äôt support.
- Follow announcements for updates adding compatibility.



## 21. FAQ: Is Swift a Virus? Is It Safe?

Swift is **not a virus**.

- Antivirus false positives are common because of memory injection behavior.
- Swift runs PowerShell only to create shortcuts.
- Executables are digitally signed and verified.
- Use trusted official sources only.



## 22. Swift is NOT a RAT ‚Äì False Positive Explanation

VirusTotal and Triage show false positives.

Key behaviors:

- VM detection (anti-VM to prevent reverse engineering).  
- PowerShell usage only for shortcut creation.  
- Downloads only update files.  
- Hardware ID checks for key system.
