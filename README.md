# Ssenualitzies Swift Fixes Guide

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING:**
> Swift is a third-party Roblox script executor that modifies Roblox process memory to inject scripts. This behavior is **detected** by Roblox‚Äôs anti-cheat systems, antivirus software, and Windows Defender.
>
> **UNC Detection: 99%**
> **SUNC Detection: 100%**
>
> Swift does **NOT** support multi-injection (multi-instance). Attempting multiple instances simultaneously will likely cause errors or bans.
>
> Use Swift **at your own risk**. We strongly recommend using **alternate accounts**, avoiding risky behavior, and backing up your data frequently.

## 1. Verify Swift Status

Before attempting any fixes or troubleshooting, always **check Swift‚Äôs current operational status**. Swift may be down for maintenance or experiencing global issues, which local fixes won‚Äôt resolve.

* Join the official Swift Discord server:
  üîó [discord.gg/getswiftgg](https://discord.gg/getswiftgg)
* Check the pinned **Status Channel** for updates about outages or patches:
  üì¢ [Status Channel](https://discord.com/channels/1311387776893321337/1364742225942286409)

Waiting for official announcements will save you time and prevent unnecessary troubleshooting.









## 2. Dependencies Installation

Swift relies on several essential runtimes and libraries to run correctly. Missing or outdated dependencies often cause authentication failures, inject timeout errors, or crashes.

Please download and install the following **latest versions** from official Microsoft sources:

* [.NET SDK 8.0.411 (Windows x64)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/sdk-8.0.411-windows-x64-installer)
  *Note: Install the full SDK, not just runtime.*
* [Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2022 (x64)](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)
* [Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2022 (x86)](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x86.exe)
* [Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=2124703)
* [DirectX Runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109)
* [Direct3D Runtime (d3d)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35)

**After installation, restart your PC** to finalize setup.









## 3. Windows Security Guide for Injection Issues

Windows Defender and antivirus software often block Swift injection, mistaking it for malicious behavior.

**To prevent inject timeout and missing file errors:**

1. Open **Windows Settings** (`Win + I`).
2. Navigate to **Update & Security > Windows Security**.
3. Open **Virus & Threat Protection**.
4. Temporarily disable:

   * **Real-time protection**
   * **Tamper protection**
5. Scroll down to **Exclusions** and add your entire Swift folder to exclusions.
6. Check antivirus quarantine/history and restore or allow any Swift-related `.exe` or `.dll` files.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Re-enable your antivirus protections once you finish using Swift to keep your system safe.









## 4. Workspace / Scripts / Auto-Execute Access Guide

If you‚Äôre unsure where to add your Lua scripts for Swift:

* Open `Run` (`Win + R`), type `%appdata%\Swift`, and press Enter.
* You‚Äôll see these folders:

  * `workspace` ‚Äî Contains internal Swift files, usually not modified.
  * `scripts` ‚Äî Store your personal `.lua` scripts here.
  * `autoexecute` ‚Äî Scripts placed here run automatically when you inject Swift.









## 5. Auto-Execute Setup Guide (First Method)

To enable auto-execution of your script upon injection:

1. Open `Run` (`Win + R`), enter:
   `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Roaming\Swift\autoexecute`
2. Create a new text file (`.txt`) with Notepad.
3. Paste your Lua script inside the `.txt` file.
4. Save and close the file.
5. Restart Swift and inject as normal; your script will run automatically.









## 6. Alternate Auto-Execute Fix (If First Method Fails)

If the above method doesn‚Äôt trigger auto-execution:

1. Close Swift completely.
2. Open the Swift installation folder.
3. Navigate to the **autoexec** folder (a shortcut to `%appdata%\Swift\autoexecute`).
4. Place your script as a `.lua` file inside this folder.
5. Launch Roblox manually.
6. Attach Swift injector to Roblox.
7. The script should execute automatically upon injection.









## 7. Time Sync Fix

System clock issues can cause key system or authentication errors.

Fix by syncing your Windows time:

1. Search for **"Date & Time"** in the Windows Start menu.
2. Open **Date & Time Settings**.
3. Click the **Sync Now** button under **Synchronize your clock**.
4. Wait until synchronization completes and try again.









## 8. Notepad / Crash Fix Guide

Roblox crashes or Swift failing to attach can be caused by corrupted or conflicting Roblox files.

To fix:

* Open `Run` (`Win + R`), type `%localappdata%`, and press Enter.
* Delete the following folders if they exist:
  `Roblox`, `Bloxstrap`, `Fishstrap`
* Reinstall Roblox using the official RDD download: [https://rdd.weao.xyz/](https://rdd.weao.xyz/) ‚Äî use the **second highlighted download**.
* Run **both Roblox and Swift as Administrator**.
* Launch Roblox, then attach Swift.









## 9. Advanced Notepad Crash / Injection Fix

If crashes persist:

* Use **Fishstrap** launcher instead of the standard Roblox client.
* Set Fishstrap‚Äôs Deployment to `Production`.
* Set Auto Channel Change Action to **Always Prompt** or download latest via RDD.
* Launch Roblox via Fishstrap or RDD [https://rdd.weao.xyz/](https://rdd.weao.xyz/) ‚Äî use the **second highlighted download**.
* Attach Swift immediately once Roblox loading screen appears.
* Refer to screenshots (provided in Discord) if unsure about Fishstrap setup.









## 10. Injection Timeout Error Fix

Injection timeout errors usually mean Swift couldn‚Äôt attach within the required window.

Fix this by:

* Using a Windows Administrator account.
* Completely uninstall Roblox and Swift.
* Reinstall Swift from [https://getswift.gg](https://getswift.gg).
* Download Roblox via RDD or Fishstrap [https://rdd.weao.xyz/](https://rdd.weao.xyz/) ‚Äî use the **second highlighted download**.
* Run both Swift and Roblox as Administrator.
* Attach Swift promptly during Roblox launch.









## 11. Black Screen on Injection Fix

Black screen issues during injection are rare but can be fixed by:

* Downloading one of the batch files from this MediaFire folder that matches your Roblox client:
  [Black Screen Fix Files](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/g3a3uxxg14qlg/Black_Screen_Fix)
* Run the batch file as Administrator.
* Alternatively, disable fullscreen optimizations for Bloxstrap:

  * Go to `%localappdata%\bloxstrap`
  * Right-click `bloxstrap.exe` > Properties > Compatibility tab
  * Check **Disable fullscreen optimizations** and apply.









## 12. Swift Not Updating / VPN Error / Website Not Loading Fix

If Swift does not update properly or key system pages fail to load:

* Download and install **Cloudflare WARP** from [https://1.1.1.1/](https://1.1.1.1/)
* Enable WARP from the system tray icon.
* Relaunch Swift and try injection again.
* For key system website issues, open the site using **Microsoft Edge** or **Chrome incognito/private mode**.









## 13. Roblox Downgrade Guide (If Swift is Down)

If Swift is incompatible with the latest Roblox update, you can downgrade Roblox:

* Visit [RDD Weao](https://rdd.weao.xyz/).
* Use the Version Hash to select an older Roblox version.
* Download and extract the ZIP file.
* Launch RobloxPlayerBeta.exe from the extracted folder.
* **Important:** Downgrading can increase ban risk; use alternate accounts and VPNs for safety.









## 14. Early Key Expire Fix

If your Swift key expires early before the full 24 hours are up:

1. Press the **Windows key + V** to open your clipboard history.
2. Look for the old key you copied, which should look like:
   `vOTKbCmhsfvWszModDHQRcKjTxmcuQnUaRSSqoMHuUPyr`
3. Copy that old key and paste it into the Swift key section on the UI.
4. Press **Submit**.
5. If it works, yippie!
6. If it doesn‚Äôt, you must repeat the key system steps [üîë WorkLink Easy Key Method ‚Äì Full Guide](#15-worklink-easy-key-method--full-guide)

## 23. FAQ: Is Swift a Virus? Is It Safe?

Swift is **NOT a virus**.

* Antivirus programs flag it due to memory injection behavior.
* PowerShell is used only to create a desktop shortcut.
* Swift is digitally signed and verified.
* Always download from official and trusted sources.









## 24. Swift is NOT a RAT ‚Äì False Positive Explanation

VirusTotal and other scans show false positives because:

* Anti-VM detection prevents reverse engineering in virtual machines.
* PowerShell usage is limited to shortcut creation.
* Downloads are only for updates.
* Hardware ID checks secure the key system.
